# dijkstra-graphs
Written for Data Structures and Algorithms class. An implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm.

Program takes in an input file used to build a graph. Then it processes said graph to find the minimum distance to reach a certain node from any other node in the graph.

The program outputs a .txt file with the shortest path to the chosen node.
